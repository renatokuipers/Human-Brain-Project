# Human-Brain-Project
A comprehensive, modular Python project for simulating various aspects of human brain function, including neuronal dynamics, network interactions, sensory processing, and cognitive functions. Based on empirical data and integrates machine learning for pattern recognition.

Thus Human Brain Simulation Project is an ambitious initiative to develop a modular and comprehensive Python-based framework for simulating various aspects of human brain function. The project aims to integrate empirical data, advanced computational models, and machine learning techniques to create a realistic representation of brain dynamics, network interactions, sensory processing, cognitive functions, and pathologies.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into multiple directories, each focusing on specific aspects of brain simulation:

- `common/`: Utilities, constants, and base classes
- `neurons/`: Neuron properties and dynamics
- `coding/`: Neuronal coding mechanisms
- `circuits/`: Neural circuits and networks
- `sensory_processing/`: Sensory neurons and feature detection
- `network_dynamics/`: Larger network dynamics
- `cortical_column/`: Cortical column modeling
- `learning_memory/`: Learning and memory simulations
- `multisensory_integration/`: Integration of different sensory modalities
- `cognitive_functions/`: Higher cognitive functions
- `emotional_social/`: Emotional and social neural networks
- `pathology/`: Neural pathologies and disorder simulations
- `whole_brain/`: Whole-brain interaction and dynamics
- `consciousness/`: Consciousness and higher-level simulations

Each directory contains an `__init__.py` file for Python package structuring, and modules (`*.py`) relevant to each simulation aspect.
