# Human Brain Project:

# For each phase, the project would grow in complexity, requiring a review of existing models, 
# potentially incorporating machine learning techniques for pattern recognition, 
# and always ensuring the project stays grounded in empirical data.

# Each directory contains an `__init__.py` file to ensure the directory is treated as a Python package, 
# and each module (`*.py`) contains the relevant classes and functions for that aspect of the simulation.

# This project structure allows for clear separation of concerns, 
# making it easier to manage complexity as your project grows.

# Incrementally adding detailed sub-modules and classes that correspond to the specific features of the brain that is being modeled can be potentially added. 
# The key is to start small, test extensively, and build on a solid foundation.
